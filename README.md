  ## Description 

  This is a mongoDB app that has created all the necessary backend componants for a social media startup. This app allows creating, finding, updating and deleting all componants independantly.  A user can  create unique thoughts, add and delete friends along with sharing reactions to other thoughts. 

  The biggest motivator was utilizing a new tech with mongoDB and mongoose. Simplifiying the process of the previous mysql or sequalize. As a business manager, there were some really cool features and benifits of this tech and it kept pushing me to learn more in how I could utilize this tech in my current business.
  
  It is a simple plug and play. With all the routes, backend and middleware complete, someone can simply build out a front end and have a functioning social media startup. Or a message board that connects interoffice personel. 

  How easy backend development and database control can be. Obviously this is on the simple side of what its capable of doing, however, the openness of mongo can really be a powerful tool. 

 

  ## Installation
  First you will need to make sure you have mongoDB installed. Once mongo is installed then you can start the actual install of this app. 1. Clone Repo 2. Open terminal and run 'npm i' 3. Open insomnia or similar testing application. 4. From there you can start testing routes. 

  ## Usage

  I see this perfect for a message board. It lacks some required necessities for a full blown social media start up, however, its simplified nature would be perfect for a  "hey everyone! Dont forget about the dance! Whos coming" followed by other users chiming in on their status of attendance. Along with linked friends who can see that 'Sally' is attending and prompt them to go as well. Something of that nature. 

  ## Contribution

  Comments, questions about future development, or feedback on the current status of the app. I am always open to constructive critisism and welcome any type of feedback. Thank you for looking.

  ## Tests

  No formal tests. Just lots of trial and error. The reactions gave me the most trouble and trying all kinds of different aproaches to make it work. Finally figured it out.
